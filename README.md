AutoWikiImage2DocFile - AutoMagical Image Integration

AutoWikiImage2DocFile:

AutoWikiImage2DocFile, also known as Image2DocFile, is a powerful Python script that automates the process of enchantingly integrating captivating images from the Wikimedia API into Word (.doc) files. With seamless keyword matching, this tool effortlessly retrieves relevant images and artfully embeds them into your documents, saving you valuable time and effort.

Features:

Effortless Image Retrieval: 

Utilizing the Wikimedia API, AutoWikiImage2DocFile intelligently searches for images based on keyword matching, ensuring that the inserted images perfectly complement your document content.

Parallel Image Fetching: 

With a built-in ThreadPoolExecutor, AutoWikiImage2DocFile fetches images in parallel, optimizing performance and reducing processing time.

Keyword Extraction: 

AutoWikiImage2DocFile intelligently extracts keywords from your document, enabling precise image retrieval and integration.

Customizable Insertion Options: 

Fine-tune the image integration process to your specific requirements with customizable keyword matching and image insertion options.

Commercial Viability: 

Designed with the potential for commercial success in mind, AutoWikiImage2DocFile enables you to monetize your project while attracting collaborators and contributors.

Caching: 

The fetch_image function now incorporates caching using the cachetools library, reducing the number of requests made to the Wikimedia API by caching results for a specified period of time.

Progress Bar: 

The keyword processing loop now features a progress bar using the tqdm library, providing visual feedback on the progress of the file processing.

Asynchronous Processing: 

The process_file function has been converted into an asynchronous function, leveraging asyncio.run to execute it within the drop function. This allows the program to perform other tasks while awaiting completion of image fetching requests.

Detailed Logging: 

More detailed logging messages have been added, including in the exception handling blocks, providing improved visibility and debugging capabilities.

Enhanced Error Handling: 

Specific exception handling for requests.exceptions.RequestException has been added in the insert_image function, providing better insights into encountered issues.

PEP 8 Compliance: 

The code has been updated to adhere more closely to the PEP 8 style guide, including considerations for line length, variable naming conventions, and spacing.
